| January 21 |  1:25-1:55pm   |                                                                     Today, I went to the white boards with David and Oliver. We started by writing some coin values and a target value down so we could do some testing. We chose 1, 2, and 3 for our coin values and 6 for our target value. At first I began thinking about starting with the solution we used in cash. This would give use the largest coins first. From there, I would split each coin up into smaller and smaller coins until we had all of the possible ways to arrange the coins so they equalled the target value. However, I noticed a flaw in this problem. When we split 6 up into its largest coin values, 3 and 3, I realized that you could only split each 3 into a 2 and a 1. Because of this, you would not be able to get the solution, 2 2 2, unless you added steps to the algorithm. Because of this, I stopped pursuing this way. |

What if you started with the solution that used the most amount of coins? For my previous example, 6 would become 1 1 1 1 1 1. Then, you would just need to add all of the 1s up into all the different coin values to make every different solution. However, I wasn't quite sure how to pull this off in an algorithm, and in other messier test cases like this: 51, 24, and 5, it wouldn't work well at all. |
| January 23 |  8:45-9:12pm   |                                                                                                                                                                     By this point, I was getting a little desperate so I tried to see if there was a pattern between the size of the target value and the number of ways the coins could be used to make it, but there was no pattern :( This is around where I remembered that we could use dynamic problem solving to create an algorithm. So, I thought a lot about how we could break up the problem into smaller pieces. This is where I began thinking about how I could use dynamic programming to get my original idea to work. Maybe I could use recurrsion to break up each larger coin into 2 or more smaller coins, and add the new sequence to an array. However, I still could not solve my original problem of not being able to get the 2 2 2 sequence. |

I thought of using sort of a depth first search algorithm where you would start with the largest coin and explore all of the combinations of coins that would equal the target value from there, but I noticed that it would probably be really inefficient and take a long time. I spent the entire rest of my time thinking of other ways to break up the problem into a smaller problem, but I kept arriving at similar solutions to my other ideas and never really found anything else that would be efficient or even work. |

I began by creating all 3 of my base cases and creating the recursive call. But by the end of class, I wasn't able to get my recursive call working correctly. |

However, it still wasn't working, and I realized that I was now getting an out of bounds error. This made me realize that one of my base cases wasn't working properly. After fixing that, it worked! Then, I worked on adding memoization. There wasn't much I had to change other then creating the 2D array and checking if I had already made a recursive call. Somehow, my memoization solution worked first try, and I noticed it was much faster than my recursive solution. |
| February 1 |  4:20-4:50pm   | Finally, I began implementing tabulation. I started by filling in the first column with 1's because I remembered what you talked with us about tabulation. Then, I realized that I needed to create my 2D array to house all the ways to make each target. It took a lot of brain power to understand whether target or coins.length should be i or j. I then created my nested for loop that would loop through my 2D array. Inside the loop, I remembered that I needed to add the box coins[i] to the left of it with the box 1 above it. To do this, I first added checks to make sure I didn't go out of bounds. After testing everything, it did not work first try :( It took me a little bit, but I finally figured out that I had to do j - 1 instead of j + 1. I thought it was j + 1 at first because I was thinking of the 2D array visualy, and up is normally + 1, not - 1. After fixing that, it worked! |
