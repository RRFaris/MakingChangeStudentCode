| January 21 |     1:25-1:55pm     | Today, I went to the white boards with David and Oliver. We started by writing some coin values and a target value down so we could do some testing. We chose 1, 2, and 3 for our coin values and 6 for our target value. At first I began thinking about starting with the solution we used in cash. This would give use the largest coins first. From there, I would split each coin up into smaller and smaller coins until we had all of the possible ways to arrange the coins so they equalled the target value. However, I noticed a flaw in this problem. When we split 6 up into its largest coin values, 3 and 3, I realized that you could only split each 3 into a 2 and a 1. Because of this, you would not be able to get the solution, 2 2 2, unless you added steps to the algorithm. Because of this, I stopped pursuing this way. |

What if you started with the solution that used the most amount of coins? For my previous example, 6 would become 1 1 1 1 1 1. Then, you would just need to add all of the 1s up into all the different coin values to make every different solution. However, I wasn't quite sure how to pull this off in an algorithm, and in other messier test cases like this: 51, 24, and 5, it wouldn't work well at all. |

So, I thought a lot about how we could break up the problem into smaller pieces. This is where I began thinking about how I could use dynamic programming to get my original idea to work. Maybe I could use recurrsion to break up each larger coin into 2 or more smaller coins, and add the new sequence to an array. However, I still could not solve my original problem of not being able to get the 2 2 2 sequence. |

I thought of using sort of a depth first search algorithm where you would start with the largest coin and explore all of the combinations of coins that would equal the target value from there, but I noticed that it would probably be really inefficient and take a long time. I spent the entire rest of my time thinking of other ways to break up the problem into a smaller problem, but I kept arriving at similar solutions to my other ideas and never really found anything else that would be efficient or even work. |
